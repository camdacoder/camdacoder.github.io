A simple web application that allows users to select their mood and music genre to receive personalized song recommendations. This site is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Author : Cam Micah

Note : Personal website to be submitted for NextChapter. 

Project Structure :
```
mood-tune-selector/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Homepage
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css           # CSS file for styling
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js           # JavaScript file for dynamic functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ genre.html          # Genre selection page
â”œâ”€â”€ songselector.html   # Song recommendations page
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # Website notes
```

Future Improvements : 

1. Store and play music files locally without YouTube re-direct(copyrights).
2. Add cover album art on song data object + display on selection.
3. Extend music library to randomize choices(currently always same selections).
4. Move audio files to external DB with API access
